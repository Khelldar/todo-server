TODO:
- add structured errors
- add tests
- use bcrypt in service layer rather than postgres
- add users->todo and todo->user in types.graphql
- add boards (collection of Todos)
- add expiration to userAccessToken
    - when it's expired, try to use existing one to refresh
    - this should only work if
        - the password has been unchanged
        - the user has not "logged out of everywhere"
    - need to add a hash of password to token and something else to detect above
- add "change password"
- add "I forgot my username/password" flow
- add SSO
- host on Heroku






CONSIDER:
- group things by type rather than by layer?
- What is the relationship between Todo and TodoAggregate?
